Prebuilt binaries
-----------------

Download the binary for your platform:

* `Linux (x64) <https://dl.home-gallery.org/dist/latest/home-gallery-latest-linux-x64>`_
* `Mac (x64) <https://dl.home-gallery.org/dist/latest/home-gallery-latest-darwin-x64>`_
* `Windows (x64) <https://dl.home-gallery.org/dist/latest/home-gallery-latest-win-x64.exe>`_

Other download options can be found `here <https://dl.home-gallery.org/dist>`_.
and there are also `unstable releases <https://dl.home-gallery.org/dist/unstable>`_ from
the current development stage.

A prebuilt binary is a command line application through a selfextracting archive.
On the first start it extracts all required files to a temporary directory
and starts the gallery CLI. Please be patient on the first start.
Future starts skip the extraction and the gallery starts faster.

The gallery CLI requires a ``gallery.config.yml`` configuration file and
it is created if missing. See :ref:`configuration` section for details and comments.

By default the HomeGallery stores the configuration files in ``~/.config/home-gallery``.
The generated preview and extracted meta data files are stored in ``~/.cache/home-gallery/storage``.
For docker containers theses directories are different.

.. note::

    On Windows the app might be blocked by the anti virus application
    and should be allowed manually. The extracted files can be found at %temp% directory.

.. note::

    On Mac the app might be blocked the OS and should be allowed manually.
    See `Open a Mac app from an unidentified developer <https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-a-mac-app-from-an-unidentified-developer-mh40616/mac>`_.
