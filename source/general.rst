Why another gallery?
--------------------

My vision is to consume and discover all my digital family memories on my mobile phones served from the SoC such as Raspberry Pi.
The gallery should support myself to explore forgotten photos and videos in my archive. It should lead me through
common properties via date, place, similarity, person etc to other parts of the archive.

Further the primary storage of my media is on my hardware at home and will be for a very long time. A cloud based solution
is not an option due my privacy concerns.

I was unable to find a suitable solution for it. Since I stopped developing my first web gallery years ago, I did some progress on
web developing. Today's positiblities are incredible with face recognition, object detection, scene detection and even deshaking and upscaling
videos to name a few.

This gallery is to consume, browse and discover all my personal photos and videos.
